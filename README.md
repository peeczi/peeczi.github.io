# Welcome to Peter Czerniak's App Space

## What
---
Presented here are my front-end web apps that I am tinkering with, which I'd like to share. Albeit simple, they deliver an organic and intuitive experience. Without an overwhelming flood of content in the interface, I believe a visitor's experience can become so smooth that they get to where they wanted without realising it. The accumulated use across all apps become a unified collection of universally practical information for day to day living.

In case you already forgot, these apps are:
- simple
- intuitive
- helpful
- fun

Each app focuses on a major aspect of daily living to keep track of, to optimize well-being and life's responsibilities efficiently and effectively.

The major aspects are:

- Food
- Finances
- Errands

## Why
---
Everybody[^1] has daily maintenance of life to take care of and less time to do what they truly want. Opportunities for life's real experiences become common after using these apps.
